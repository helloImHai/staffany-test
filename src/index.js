        There are two levels to this test: <strong>Basic</strong> and{" "}
        <strong>Advanced</strong>. You can see samples for each version of the
        test below. Hit the button to switch between the basic and the advanced
        versions. You're expected to do as much as possible in the time limit
        given to you. Please don't share this test with others.

        <h3>Basic Requirements</h3>
        <ol style={{ textAlign: "left" }}>
          <li>
            User can input shift duration, overtime limit, basic rate and pay
            rate
          </li>
          <li>These should all be positive numbers (decimals are possible)</li>
          <li>
            Form Validation is <strong>not necessary</strong>
          </li>
          <li>
            Output/show somewhere on the page the "Total Pay" as calculated by
            the pay formula
          </li>
          <li>
            The exact formula for how to calculate the numbers is displayed
            inside the "Advanced" requirement
          </li>

          <li>All Basic Requirements</li>
          <li>
            User can input a start time and end time, and the form should
            calculate the number of hours
          </li>
          <li>
            You may use any third-party date time library (e.g. moment) to help
            you count hours
          </li>
          <li>Your form should perform validation that makes sense.</li>
          <li>
            You need to "Show your working" and show how you got the total pay
